This is the official rule set for the European Hardcourt Bike Polo Association (EHBA). It is based on the 2019 NAH ruleset, with some modifications and additions. The EHBA ruleset is intended to be used for all EHBA-sanctioned tournaments.

The syntax is multimarkdown, and the document is intended to be read in a markdown viewer. The document is also available in PDF format.

Specifically the original document and the exported PDF has been created with iA Writer and a custom template that visually emulate the original English version.
